Logistic Regression Week 4 General Assemby Data Science Class

The purpose of this module was to understand what logistic regression is, how to use it, and when to use it. 

I used this lab to work on my graphs and to understand which variables to use, if not all of them. 

The lab also introduced the concept of dummy ranks, for making ordinal values, and for continuing to understand how to bucket features to make them more useful than individual, continuous values. 

The homework objective was to go through yhat's tutorial (http://blog.yhathq.com/posts/logistic-regression-and-python.html). I replaced prestige 1 with prestige 4 believing that prestige 1 would have more explanatory power. 

The results of my efforts are here: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/tarasuan/313cf761016988d4b9cc
